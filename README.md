# ThatNightSky

A programmer's way of keeping a memory. Some days deserve their own sky.

## Getting Started

1. Get the code, and run it.
    ```shell
    uv run streamlit run src/thatnightsky/app.py
    ```

1. Enter Korean address, date/time, and its meaning.

1. After few seconds, you can get `That-Night-Sky`.

## How It Works

Enter a Korean address and a date/time. The app resolves coordinates via the vworld geocoding API, computes celestial positions using [skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/), and renders a star chart. A short poetic narrative is generated by Claude.

The chart uses a stereographic all-sky projection: the center is the zenith (directly overhead), and the arc at the bottom edge is the horizon. Stars below the horizon are not shown.

The star-chart rendering approach is adapted from:
